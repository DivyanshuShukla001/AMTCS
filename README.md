## 1. Introduction
The Automatic Trash Collecting System (AMTCS) is an innovative solution designed to autonomously collect trash, contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment. This system combines advanced technologies like NodeMCU, color detecting sensors, UV sensors, and a basic obstacle avoidance car to achieve its objectives.

## 2. Requirements
To build and operate the AMTCS, you will need the following components:

- NodeMCU microcontroller
- Color detecting sensors
- UV sensors
- Basic obstacle avoidance car
- Trash bin with a lid
- Air fresheners
- Vacuuming system
- Power source (e.g., battery or power supply)
- Connecting wires
- Tools for assembly (soldering iron, screwdrivers, etc.)

## 3. Code Snippet
```cpp
// Sample Arduino Code for AMTCS

#include <WiFi.h>

// Define pin connections for sensors and actuators
const int colorSensorPin = A0;
const int uvSensorPin = A1;
const int obstacleSensorPin = 2;

void setup() {
  // Initialize sensors and actuators
  pinMode(colorSensorPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(uvSensorPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(obstacleSensorPin, INPUT);

  // Initialize WiFi and connect to a network
  // (Add your WiFi credentials)
  WiFi.begin("SSID", "PASSWORD");
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
  }
}

void loop() {
  int colorValue = analogRead(colorSensorPin);
  int uvValue = analogRead(uvSensorPin);
  int obstacleValue = digitalRead(obstacleSensorPin);

  if (colorValue < 500) {
    // Trash detected, move towards it
    // Implement navigation logic here
  }

  if (uvValue > 700) {
    // UV sensor detects trash, trigger disposal mechanism
    // Implement trash disposal logic here
  }

  if (obstacleValue == HIGH) {
    // Obstacle detected, implement obstacle avoidance logic
    // (e.g., change direction or stop and wait)
  }
}
```

## 4. System Components

### NodeMCU
The NodeMCU is a powerful microcontroller based on the ESP8266 WiFi module. It provides the brains of the AMTCS, enabling it to connect to the internet for remote monitoring and control.

### Color Detecting Sensors
These sensors are used for path detection and navigation. They can differentiate between different colors, allowing the AMTCS to follow a predefined path.

### UV Sensors
UV sensors are responsible for automatically detecting trash in the vicinity. When a certain threshold of UV radiation is detected, it indicates the presence of trash in the proximity.

### Basic Obstacle Avoidance Car
This component serves as the physical base for the AMTCS. It is equipped with motors and wheels for movement. The obstacle avoidance mechanism ensures the system can navigate around obstacles in its path.

### Trash Bin
The trash bin is equipped with a lid that can be opened automatically by the AMTCS for disposal.

### Air Fresheners
Air fresheners are integrated into the system to help maintain a pleasant environment while collecting trash.

### Vacuuming System
This system component is used to clean the area after trash collection.

## 5. Implementation and Usage
The AMTCS operates by following these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Upon startup, the NodeMCU connects to a WiFi network.
2. **Sensors Readings**: The color and UV sensors continuously monitor their respective parameters.
3. **Trash Detection**: When the color sensor detects a predefined color indicative of trash, the AMTCS moves towards it.
4. **UV Trash Detection**: If the UV sensor detects a high UV radiation level, it indicates the presence of trash, triggering the disposal mechanism.
5. **Obstacle Avoidance**: The obstacle sensor helps the AMTCS avoid obstacles by adjusting its path or stopping and waiting for a clear way.
6. **Trash Disposal**: Once the AMTCS reaches the trash, it uses the UV sensor data to confirm the presence of trash and initiate the disposal process.
7. **Air Freshening and Vacuuming**: After trash collection, the AMTCS can activate air fresheners and vacuuming systems to maintain cleanliness.

## 6. Benefits to the Environment
The AMTCS offers several environmental benefits:

- **Reduced Litter**: By autonomously collecting trash, it helps reduce litter on streets and public spaces.
- **Efficient Waste Management**: It streamlines the process of trash collection, making it more efficient and cost-effective.
- **Minimized Human Contact**: It reduces the need for human involvement in potentially unsanitary environments, improving public health.

## 7. Conclusion
The Automatic Trash Collecting System (AMTCS) is an innovative solution that leverages modern technology to automate the process of trash collection. By integrating various sensors and actuators, it can navigate, detect, and dispose of trash in an efficient and environmentally-friendly manner. This system represents a significant step towards cleaner and healthier urban environments.
