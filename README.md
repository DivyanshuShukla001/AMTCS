## 1. Introduction

The Automatic Trash Collecting System (AMTCS) is an innovative solution designed to autonomously collect and manage trash in indoor environments. This system utilizes a combination of sensors, microcontrollers, and a basic obstacle-avoidance car to efficiently collect trash, thus promoting a cleaner and healthier environment.

## 2. Requirements

To build the AMTCS, the following components are required:

- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- Color Detecting Sensors
- UV Sensors
- Basic Obstacle Avoidance Car
- Air Fresheners (optional)
- Vacuuming Mechanism
- Trash Bin

## 3. System Components

### 3.1 NodeMCU (ESP8266)

The NodeMCU serves as the central processing unit of the AMTCS. It's responsible for data processing, decision-making, and communication with various sensors and actuators.

### 3.2 Color Detecting Sensors

These sensors are used to identify different types of trash based on their color. This information is crucial for sorting and managing waste effectively.

### 3.3 UV Sensors

UV sensors are employed to detect harmful microorganisms or contaminants on the trash. This ensures a cleaner and safer environment.

### 3.4 Basic Obstacle Avoidance Car

The car serves as the mobile platform for the AMTCS. It's equipped with motors, wheels, and sensors to navigate through the environment while avoiding obstacles.

### 3.5 Air Fresheners

Optional air fresheners can be integrated to maintain a pleasant atmosphere in the vicinity of the system.

### 3.6 Vacuuming Mechanism

The vacuuming mechanism is used to clean the area after the trash has been collected, ensuring a thorough cleanup.

### 3.7 Trash Bin

The trash bin is the receptacle where collected trash is stored until it needs to be emptied.

## 4. Code Snippet

```cpp
// Sample Arduino code snippet for the AMTCS

#include <WiFiClient.h>

void setup() {
  // Initialize sensors, actuators, and communication
  // Set up WiFi connection
  // Set up MQTT or other communication protocols
}

void loop() {
  // Read data from color detecting sensors
  // Read data from UV sensors
  // Control obstacle avoidance car
  // Make decisions based on sensor data
  // Send status updates to a central server or display on a dashboard
  // Activate vacuuming and air fresheners as needed
}
```

This is a simplified code snippet. The actual implementation will require integration with specific sensor libraries, motor control, communication protocols, and additional functionalities.

## 5. How It Works

1. The color detecting sensors scan the area for trash, identifying different types based on color.
2. UV sensors detect harmful microorganisms or contaminants on the trash.
3. The NodeMCU processes this data and makes decisions based on predefined logic.
4. The obstacle avoidance car navigates through the environment, avoiding obstacles in its path.
5. When the car reaches a piece of trash, it uses a mechanism to collect and deposit it into the trash bin.
6. Air fresheners may be activated to maintain a pleasant environment.
7. After trash collection, the vacuuming mechanism cleans the area to ensure a thorough cleanup.
8. Status updates may be sent to a central server or displayed on a dashboard for monitoring.

## 6. Benefits to the Environment

The AMTCS offers several environmental benefits:

1. **Efficient Waste Management:** The system effectively collects and manages trash, reducing the risk of pollution and contamination.

2. **Reduced Human Intervention:** With autonomous operation, the system minimizes the need for manual intervention in waste collection.

3. **Improved Indoor Air Quality:** Air fresheners and vacuuming mechanisms contribute to a cleaner and healthier indoor environment.

4. **Contaminant Detection:** UV sensors help identify and mitigate potential health hazards associated with contaminants on the trash.

5. **Promotes Recycling:** The color detecting sensors facilitate the sorting of recyclable materials, contributing to sustainable waste management practices.
